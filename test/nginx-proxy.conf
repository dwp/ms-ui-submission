# Use this config script to stand up a basic forwarding proxy that will take
# incoming URLs, and prefix them with the proxy path before forwarding to your
# actual Express app.
#
# This config expects the following out of the box, so alter to suit your needs:
# - your app to be running on port 3000
# - your app to be mounted on `/proxy-prefix-here/`
#
# Usage:
# - Start the app, which might look something like this: `CONTEXT_PATH_PROXY=/proxy-prefix-here/ CONTEXT_PATH=/ PORT=3000 npm start`
# - Start this proxy with: `docker run --rm --name nginx -it -v $PWD/tests/nginx-proxy.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro -p 8080:80 nginx`
# - Now access your app via http://localhost:8080/
